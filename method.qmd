# Method

## Data collection
How we collected the data and why we selected the parameters that we did. Did not collect price for new car.

## Training and evaluating models
* How the data was prepared for fitting.
* Mark, Model and Mark/Model?
* Motor size does not make sense for electric cars. We need to decide whether to drop the column, or drop the electric cars. Start by looking at a model with the electric cars dropped to see if the motor size is significant for the remaining observations.
